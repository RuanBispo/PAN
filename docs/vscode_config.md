## Installation

The Visual Studio Code can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Extensions used:
- Material Icon Theme
- Python Debugger
- Docker

To add the extensions it is just go to the left bar inside of the vscode, go to extensions, and search each one.

## Basic setup

First of all, you have to open your work directory. (it used to be the repo you cloned, or a new one). Go to `File -> Open folder` inside of the vscode menu.
In our case it will be the folder `~/Documents/code/PAN`. When you close the vscode it will ask you if you want to save the workspace, if you save it you can always start with this same configuration.

## Conda setup

Obs.: You just need this if you are using a conda environment. There's no need if you are using docker.

To configure the standard conda environment you can create a file called ..., this way every time that you open a terminal it will use the selected environment.
