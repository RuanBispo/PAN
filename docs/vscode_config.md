## Installation

The Visual Studio Code can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Extensions used:
- Material Icon Theme
- Python Debugger
- Docker

To add the extensions it is just go to the left bar inside of the vscode, go to extensions, and search each one.

## Basic setup

First of all, you have to open your work directory:
```
File -> Open folder
```
After this you can add all folders or projects you need using:
```
File -> Add folder to the workspace
```
When you close the vscode it will ask you if you want to save the workspace, if you save it you can always start with this same configuration.

## Conda setup

Obs.: You just need this if you are using a conda environment. There's no need if you are using docker.

To configure the standard conda environment you can create a file called ..., this way every time that you open a terminal it will use the selected environment.
